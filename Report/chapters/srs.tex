This chapter aims to provide detailed specifications of the system under development, including the functional and non-functional requirements, giving an overview of the application by providing the mock-up screens along with the details of the interface. This chapter also sheds light upon the working of certain features of the application. 

\section{Functional Requirements}

This section describes each function/feature provided by our system. These functions are logically grouped into modules based on their purpose/users/mode of operations etc (as per our system):
\begin{outline}
  \subsection{Web Application}
  Some of the functionalities provided by the we application are as follows:
  \1 Allows customers to upload a photo of an outfit.
  \1 Displays constituent items of uploaded outfit.
  \1 Allows customers to click on a constituent item and view items identical/similar to it.
  \1 Allows customers to click on an item and open it's product page.
  \1 Displays item title, description, price, photos and sizes on product page.
  \1 On the product page, displays recommendations for similar products, as received from the recommendation engine.
  \1 On the product page, displays recommendations for complementary products, as received from the recommendation engine.
  \1 Allows customer to add item to cart.
  \1 Allows new customers to sign-up.
  \1 Allows returning customers to login.
  \1 Saves user history to database.
  \1 For existing customers with user history, the application displays recommendations based on user history, as received from the recommendation engine, on the home page.
  \1 For existing customers with a user history, the application displays recommendations based on user history, as received from the recommendation engine, on product pages.
  \1 For new customers or existing customers without user history, the application displays items currently trending on the store, on the home page.
  \1 Admin has exclusive access to an admin panel that allows them to add, remove and modify items on the website. 
  \1 Admin can view customer activity.
\end{outline}
\begin{outline}
  \subsection{Recommendation Engine}
  The engine can be roughly compartmentalized as follows:
  \1 On uploaded photo, calls feature extraction model and performs multiple object detection. To bounding boxes of each individual piece of clothing in the outfit.
  \1 Crops each bounding box in image and returns them. Each bounding box represents an article of clothing.
  \1 Upon receiving which bounding box has been selected by the user, it passes that to nearest neighbour model. Returns ids of n closest neighbours of that item from the database and ids of n best complimentary items.
\end{outline}
\begin{outline}
  \subsection{Database}
  \1 Should store id, title, price, description, sizes, category and tags for each item.
  \1 Should store user and admin account information.
  \1 Should store user profile information, including past logs, search history, purchase history, as well as other related actions.
\end{outline}
\begin{outline}
  \subsection{Web Scraper}
  \1 Crawl local fashion stores `Furor', `Export Leftovers', `J.', `Zellbury', etc.
  \1 For each item of men's clothing on the store, save the photo, description and price locally.
  \1 Add timed cron job functionality so that the database can be verified and kept up to date without discrepancies.
\end{outline}

\section{Non-functional Requirements}
Some of the non-functional requirements of the system under development are identified as follows:
\subsection{Performance Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item High performance of the computer on which the server is hosted is needed to cater to thousands of users. 
    
    \item Fetching the dashboard to view information and recommended outfits shall take no longer than 5 seconds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Safety Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system must not halt or lag, especially during the update time and must not go down under high traffic. In order to ensure safety of the server, it is suggested that it is hosted on two computers - one kept as a backup.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It must be ensured that only the authorized admins, with valid user credentials, have access to the data of the users in order to ensure user privacy. 
    
    \item The system will use databases from authentic sources and fashion stores.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The UI/UX flow needs to be intuitive as well as modern. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Error Handling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system prevents data loss by carefully handling all expected and non-expected errors. 
\end{itemize}

\section{External Interfaces}

\subsection{Application Program Interface (API)}
The system will be built using the Django framework at the server-end, and React.JS at the client-end (explained in detail in \autoref{srs:sysdiag}). We aim to use REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs, served through the Django REST framework, for all client-server communication since RESTful services as an architectural style would lead to our application being lightweight and scalable. However, since graph-based communication channels are gaining more popularity and adaptation rates in internet technologies these days, and for reasons summarized in \autoref{table:tech-api} ahead, our eventual goal is to establish an API based entirely off of GraphQL. So, for purposes of this web-application, our API will be written primarily as a RESTful service, but will be exposed to the client through a schema-first approach using a GraphQL wrapper. \autoref{api:diag} summarizes this.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=15cm]{images/APIDiagram.pdf} 
\centering
\caption{API Diagram}
\label{api:diag}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
Based on the project requirements and keeping the communication channels in mind, the chosen technology stack for the client-end is: TypeScript, React, and \href{https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo}{React Apollo} (for interacting with the GraphQL API), and for the server-end is: Python, Django, and \href{https://github.com/graphql-python/graphene-django}{Graphene Django} (for creating the GraphQL API). \autoref{table:tech-server}, \autoref{table:tech-client}, and \autoref{table:tech-api} offer a detailed comparison between why these communication interfaces were picked over some of their major competitors.

\section{Datasets}
This section describes the specific dataset which will be used to build our system. An appropriate snapshot of the dataset is also included in in the description below which further signifies the relevance of the used dataset. Futher details regarding the daatset are provided in the appendix below.

For purposes of the image classification pipeline for our recommendation engine, we have selected DeepFashion \cite{DeepFashion} as our preliminary dataset. The dataset consists over 800,000 diverse fashion images ranging from well-posed shop images to unconstrained consumer photos. What makes this dataset suitable towards our system is the fact that it is annotated with rich information of clothing items. Each image in this dataset is labelled with 50 categories, 1,000 descriptive attributes, bounding box and clothing landmarks, and this would kick-start the training of our classifier. A category-wise subset of the dataset is depicted in \autoref{dataset:DeepFashion}. 

It is important to clarify here that the DeepFashion dataset consists of product images from western stores and outlets, so the classifier would not generalize efficiently to products in the local eastern domain, which is a  requirement of our system. Moreover, there are limitations in the amount of products and datasets we can scrape from eastern fashion stores such as J., Export Leftovers, Zellbury, Daraz, etc. If we were to use these as the only data for training our classifier, the model would indubitably suffer from underfitting. In order to maintain a good fit, we will use the concept of Transfer Learning to re-train the classifier trained on DeepFashion on our local scraped dataset from the aforementioned local fashion stores.
