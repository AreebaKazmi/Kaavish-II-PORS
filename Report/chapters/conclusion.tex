First of all, we would like to configure the recommendation model as a micro-service API and deploy the web application to a Web Server to make it feasible and accessible to both, the shoppers and the retailers.

Refining the results of our AI model is another important step. Once the application is deployed and available publicly, there is a chance of collaborating with more local brands, meaning more data to feed into the AI model, consequently improving the recommendations. Additionally, the model will be trained in eastern fashion to make eastern recommendations more intelligent and robust, which is one of the novelties of this thesis. Furthermore, if the likes, dislikes, and purchase history of the customer are taken into account, it will further help to make the experience and recommendations more personalized for each customer. 

Lastly, a portable version of web application or a mobile application for Android and iOS would do a great deal in reaching out to a larger audience.
