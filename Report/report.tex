\chapter*{Abstract}
The two main challenges faced by outfit recommendation is of visual understanding and matching. It includes the extraction of visual features and mixing and matching them according to the features compatibility and human capability and fashion sense. However, this can be time-consuming and cumbersome when done manually. And retailers do spend an ample amount of time in selecting and organizing the products to provide the best combinations of outfits to the consumers. However, the options are still not personalized. \newline

To address this problem, we propose a personalized outfit recommendation system (PORS). PORS is a web-application for consumers, which allows a shopper to search a product visually by uploading an image as an input and get similar (and of the same type eg. a shirt for a shirt) and complementary (eg. a pant for a shirt) outfit recommendations from the items available on the store.\newline

PORS uses a model, which uses an approach relying only on a feature network and use Euclidean distance to find similar vectors. Our feature network consists of a ResNet50 model trained on the DeepFashion - the largest and best-annotated dataset in the domain of fashion consisting of more than 800,000 richly annotated images, with 50 categories and 1000 descriptive attributes - clothing classification benchmark using transfer learning. This feature network converts images into a 512-dim feature vector. Images whoâ€™s feature vector has minimum Euclidean distance from the query feature vector; are then displayed on our web-application.\newline

Currently, some of the local stores like J., Furor, Zellbury, Export Leftovers, and a dummy store, are available on our web-application. The model was further trained on the stores available on our web-application but as the eastern dataset was comparatively less, so our model suffers from underfitting. However, the performance would improve as we train our model on some more eastern clothing.
